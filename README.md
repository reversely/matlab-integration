### Summary
"Integration and Error Analysis" approximates definite integrals using Riemann sums and the trapezoid method, and estimates approximation errors.

"Numerical Methods for Multiple Integrals" approximates multiple integrals using the trapezoid rule with MATLAB functions.

"Gradient Descent" is an algorithm for calculating local minimums by calculating the gradient of a function. It obtains partial derivatives using finite difference formulas.
