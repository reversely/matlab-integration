### Summary
"Integration and Error Analysis" approximates definite integrals using Riemann sums and the trapezoid method, and estimates approximation errors.

"Numerical Methods for Multiple Integrals" approximates multiple integrals using the trapezoid rule with MATLAB functions.

"Gradient Descent" is an algorithm for calculating local minimums by calculating the gradient of a function. It obtains partial derivatives using finite difference formulas.

"Eulerian Three-Body Approximation" is a tool to find a numerical solution of Euler’s 3-body problem. The three-body problem studies the movement of three masses relative to each other, when under the influence of gravity and Newton’s second law. A function within the script represents the system of differential equations as a first-order system, and uses ode45 to approximate the trajectory of three planets in a system. The trajectories of the planets are also plotted.
